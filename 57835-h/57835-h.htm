<p><i>&rdquo;... His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible
I have ever known, no motives ... of friendship or hatred being
able to bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every sense of
the words, a wise, a good, and a great man.... His heart was
not warm in its affections; but he exactly calculated every man&rsquo;s
value and gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it.... Although
in the circle of his friends ... he took a free share in
conversation, his colloquial talents were not above mediocrity,
possessing neither copiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words....
Yet he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an easy and correct
style.... On the whole, his character was, in its mass, perfect,
in nothing bad, in few points indifferent; and it may truly be
said, that never did nature and fortune combine more perfectly
to make a man great, and to place him in the same constellation
with whatever worthies have merited from man an everlasting
remembrance. For his was the singular destiny and merit, of
leading the armies of his country successfully through an arduous
war, for the establishment of its independence; of conducting
its councils through the birth of a government, new in its
forms and principles, until it had settled down into a quiet and
orderly train; and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the
whole of his career, civil and military, of which the history of
the world furnishes no other example....&rdquo;</i></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="xlarge"><b>T</b></span>he story of the Washington family plantation in Westmoreland
County, Va., where George Washington was born on February
22, 1732, may be divided into 3 main parts. The first
relates to the activities of the early Washingtons who lived on the
plantation during the latter third of the 17th century and fourscore
years of the 18th century&mdash;a period covering 115 years. During that
time the plantation between Bridges Creek and Popes Creek grew;
successive members of the Washington family became prosperous
planters, acquired large landholdings, and attained important civic
and political offices in their county and colony. The climactic year
of this first period was 1732&mdash;the 6th year in the reign of King George
II and the 125th year in the history of the colony&mdash;when George,
the son of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington, was born. The
period ends during the American Revolution when the home in
which George first saw the light of day accidentally caught fire,
burned to the ground, and was abandoned as a homesite.</p>
<p>The second period spans a hundred years&mdash;a century when the birthplace
site was neglected, and was all but forgotten by a growing nation
which showed little or no interest in preserving the birthplace of its
great military leader and first president. Wild honeysuckle and
bramble thickets covered the foundations of the burned home; the
place was forgotten for so many years that knowledge of the exact
location and use of many of the plantation buildings became lost.</p>

<p>The third and last period of the story covers the years when the
Federal Government, various individuals, and patriotic organizations
became interested in preserving the historic site; a period culminating
in the preservation of the ancient plantation by the Wakefield National
Memorial Association and the United States Government.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>John Washington</i></span></h2>
<p>In late 1656, or early 1657, John Washington, about 24 years old,
arrived in the Potomac River in Westmoreland County, Va., as mate
of the Ketch, <i>Sea Horse of London</i>. Owing to a disagreement with
the owner and captain of the vessel, Edward Prescott, John decided
to remain in Virginia.</p>
<p>Of John&rsquo;s early history little is known. He was born in England
about 1632, son of the Reverend Lawrence Washington (M.A., B.D.,
Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, Rector of Purleigh, Essex) and
Amphillis Twigden of Northamptonshire. In November 1640,
Charles I presented John with a &ldquo;scholar&rsquo;s place&rdquo; at Sutton Hospital
(Charterhouse School), but owing to a long waiting list he did not
receive an appointment and appears to have been educated elsewhere.</p>
<p>A year or two after his arrival in Virginia, John married Anne
Pope and, in 1659, was given land on Mattox Creek by his father-in-law,
Col. Nathaniel Pope. Here their first son, Lawrence (George&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
grandfather), was born in September 1659. John quickly took rank
with the important men of his community. In 1661 he was elected
a vestryman of his church. The same year he was appointed coroner,
and in 1662 he was made justice of Westmoreland County Court.
In 1664 a distinct honor was accorded him&mdash;the changing of the
name of Appomattox Parish in Westmoreland County to Washington
Parish, the one it bears today.</p>
<p>On December 3, 1664, John Washington purchased from David
Anderson 100 acres on the east side of Bridges Creek (only a short
distance from its confluence with the Potomac River), and there he and
Anne established their second home. Known as the Bridges Creek
plantation, it was the first tract of land acquired by a Washington on
the area which today is designated as George Washington Birthplace
National Monument. There John and his family lived and prospered,
and there he developed his tidewater plantation and carried out many
important duties for his King and colony. (Seventy-eight years after
John acquired the Bridges Creek property it was purchased by George&rsquo;s
father, Augustine Washington, and for the first time became a part
of the plantation which later became known as &ldquo;Wakefield&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>About 1672, John was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the
county militia and, in 1675, was directed to raise troops to conduct a
campaign against the Doeg Indians in Maryland who had made forays
into Virginia and murdered three citizens. On at least two occasions,
John represented his county in the Virginia House of Burgesses and
attended its sessions at Jamestown, the &ldquo;Capital Cittie&rdquo; of the colony.
In 1676 he actively supported Royal Governor William Berkeley against
rebellious Nathaniel Bacon and his followers, and later was awarded
9,950 pounds of tobacco for his part in raising forces to aid in suppressing
the rebellion.</p>
<p>By importing servants whose land &ldquo;headrights&rdquo; he could claim by
purchase, by original patent, and by taking up grants of deserted land,
John yearly added to his holdings, and at the time of his death owned
several thousand acres of land in tidewater Virginia, including the
property on the Potomac which later became known as Mount Vernon.
John died in 1677 and was buried in the family cemetery at Bridges
Creek, about 1&frac14; miles northwest of the site where his illustrious great-grandson,
George, was born 55 years later.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Lawrence Washington</i></span></h2>
<p>Lawrence Washington was 5 years old when his parents moved from
Mattox Creek to the Bridges Creek plantation. Except for a few
months when he may have attended grammar school in England, he
lived at Bridges Creek until early manhood. He was 18 when his
father, John Washington, died; being the eldest son, he inherited the
largest share of the land. As he grew and matured, he became a man
of means, culture, and ability, and during his short life-span of 39 years
he was honored with the highest political offices which the citizens of
Westmoreland County could bestow.</p>

</div>
<p>Following in his father&rsquo;s footsteps, he served as justice of the Court
of Westmoreland County, as an officer in the county militia, and a
member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. He was first elected to the
latter office when only 25, serving four terms as a burgess in the Colonial
Assembly at Jamestown. Another position he held for several years
was sheriff of Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>In 1690 Lawrence married Mildred Warner of Gloucester County,
Va., daughter of a prominent planter, Augustine Warner, who at one
time had been speaker of the House of Burgesses and a member of the
Governor&rsquo;s council. Their second son, Augustine, born in 1694, was
destined to become the father of George Washington.</p>
<p>Lawrence Washington died in 1698, and was interred in the family
cemetery at Bridges Creek. He left a sizeable estate to his wife and
three children (his personal property alone consisted of &pound;406 and
32,509 pounds of tobacco), and to each of the two Anglican churches in
Washington Parish he provided for &ldquo;a Pulpett Cloth &amp; Cushion.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>Augustine Washington</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">EARLY LIFE.</span></h3>
<p>George Washington&rsquo;s father, Augustine Washington,
was born at Mattox Creek, Westmoreland County, Va., in 1694. He
remembered little of his father, as Lawrence Washington died when
Augustine was only 4 years old. Two years later his mother married
George Gale, and during the autumn of 1700, the family moved
to England. Their family life abroad was short-lived, however, as
Augustine&rsquo;s mother died a year later, when he was only seven. His
stepfather, who seems to have been a kindly man, sent Augustine
and his brother, John, to Appelby School. Their schooling, too, was
cut short, for a year or two later the boys returned to Virginia to
live with their elder cousin, John Washington of &ldquo;Chotank,&rdquo; whose
plantation was located on the Potomac, about 20 miles up the river
from Bridges Creek. While little is known of Augustine&rsquo;s teen-age
activities one can surmise that he enjoyed plantation life to the utmost
while living with various relatives whose farms were located on the
wooded south shore of the Potomac River.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><span class="sc">FIRST MARRIAGE.</span></h3>
<p>Augustine Washington became of age in 1715, and
shortly thereafter married Jane Butler, daughter of Caleb Butler, a
successful Westmoreland County lawyer and planter. Four children
were born of this union: Butler, 1716 (who died in infancy); Lawrence,
1718 (who built and named Mount Vernon); Augustine, Jr.,
1719 or 1720; and Jane, 1722.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 id="c6"><span class="sc">PURCHASE OF POPES CREEK FARM.</span></h3>
<p>In 1717-18 Augustine Washington
bought from Joseph Abbington 150 acres of land on Popes Creek&mdash;a
beautiful tract overlooking the tidal creek and the Potomac River.
Popes Creek, running along the east side of the tract, was approximately
one-half mile wide, and joined the Potomac half-a-mile away.
From Augustine&rsquo;s land the river could be seen clearly, as it was over
5 miles wide from the Virginia side to the distant Maryland shore.
Augustine&rsquo;s historic piece of property is described in <i>Westmoreland
Deeds and Wills</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that one hundred and fifty acres of lands scituate in the said County
of Westmoreland aforesd and bounded Viz. Beginning at a marked
hiccory on the head of the dancing marsh and so running down the
said line to Popes Creek thence up the said Creek to the line of Nathaniel
Washingtons and then up that line to include the aforesd One
hundred and fifty acres of land which was given to Lawrence Abbington
&amp; his daughter Lydia Abbington together....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tract probably included Joseph Abbington&rsquo;s home, for the purchase
covered &ldquo;all houses, edifices, buildings, tobacco houses, fences,
orchards, and gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c7"><span class="sc">BUILDING THE BIRTHPLACE HOME.</span></h3>
<p>Some time between 1723 and 1725
Augustine Washington hired David Jones, a local carpenter and
undertaker, to build a house on his Popes Creek property for 5,000
pounds of tobacco with extra amounts in cash for incidentals. The late
Charles A. Hoppin, authority on the Washington family, believed
that George&rsquo;s father had the brick for his new home made on the
plantation grounds, the foundations built, and many timbers hewed
for the building before Jones began construction of the house. Jones
also contracted to build for Augustine &ldquo;2 bedsteads,&rdquo; &ldquo;1 cradle,&rdquo; &ldquo;2
Mantoll [mantel]pieces,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a small Poplar Table.&rdquo; David Jones
died in 1725, before the Washington house was completed, and Augustine
entered a claim against his estate asking the sum of 500 pounds
of tobacco. It may be inferred that the home was completed in 1726
and was about 6 years old at the time of George&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><span class="sc">THE BIRTHPLACE.</span></h3>
<p>While little is known about the appearance of the
home in which George was born, the foundations and cellar floors
uncovered during archeological excavations revealed that it was built
either partially or entirely of brick. Several foundations of outbuildings
were unearthed, and all were constructed of brick. So, also,
all walls, cellar stairways, wine vaults, and fireplaces that have been
excavated were built of brick.</p>
<p>The location of the new home was superb, being on a rise of ground
26 feet above Popes Creek and a little over 200 feet inland from its
high western bank. To the east and northeast were pretty water
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
views; to the north, beyond cleared fields, was Dancing Marsh, green
with lush grass and swamp plants; and to the southeast, 100 yards or
so away, was a little peninsula which jutted out into Popes Creek
(now heavily wooded with a beautiful grove of eastern redcedar,
<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>). To the west of the house were pastures and
cleared fields, and beyond the clearings was the dense forest&mdash;a mixed
stand of broadleaf trees and evergreens. A farm road ran in a northwesterly
direction for a mile or so, passing by the family burying
ground where rested Augustine&rsquo;s father and grandfather and other
early members of the family. A short distance beyond the burying
ground the road came to an end at the sandy south shore of the Potomac
River.</p>
<p>The new home must have been rather commodious for a 1762 inventory
of its furnishings lists 10 bedsteads, 13 tables, 57 chairs, 8
mirrors, 8 chests, accessories for 8 fireplaces, and scores of other furnishings
and household items befitting a fairly large establishment. Certainly,
the house in which George was born could not have been the
humble 1-story clapboard structure portrayed in 19th-century imaginative
sketches by artists who probably knew little about the social and
economic status of George&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Though not a man of great wealth, Augustine was able to send two
sons to England for schooling. Early 18th-century objects unearthed
near the foundations of his Popes Creek home, offer ample proof that
he imported fine quality silver, pewter, glassware, and pottery from
the mother country, and could afford to have his monogram stamped
on his wine bottles. He was a man of some influence in his community,
having held at various times the positions of justice of Westmoreland
County Court, captain in the county militia, sheriff of Westmoreland
County, and a vestryman of his church. He was part-owner
of two iron-furnaces&mdash;Accokeek in Virginia and Principio in Maryland&mdash;and
was financially able to visit England on two occassions to
deal directly with his partners. He owned land and buildings in 3
Virginia counties and was master of at least 49 slaves. Though not
as wealthy as certain other planters in the Northern Neck (the tidewater
counties lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers),
he was a man of good social standing.</p>

<p>Jane Butler Washington did not enjoy the new Popes Creek home
many years, for in 1729 (when only 30) she died, leaving Augustine
with the care of the 3 children. Lawrence, the eldest, was only 11.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><span class="sc">SECOND MARRIAGE.</span></h3>
<p>Sixteen months after Jane&rsquo;s death, Augustine married
another young lady from the Northern Neck, Mary Ball, on March
6, 1731. Mary was born at &ldquo;Epping Forest&rdquo; in Lancaster County, and
was left an orphan at the age of 12. Between that time and the day of
her marriage to Augustine Washington (when she was 23) she had
lived with two prominent Westmoreland County families&mdash;the
George Eskridges and the Samuel Bonums. George Eskridge, a
kindly guardian, was like a real father to Mary and it is believed
that she later named her first-born child after him.</p>
<p>Following her marriage to Augustine, Mary moved to his Popes
Creek home where his 3 children were in need of their new mother.
She soon gained the respect of her stepchildren&mdash;Lawrence 13, Augustine
12, and Jane about 9. Accustomed to farm life, Mary quickly
assumed her new duties as mistress and manager of the household, and
time passed quickly for her.</p>
<p>As February 1732 approached, Augustine and Mary Washington
knew that their first son or daughter soon was to join the family. What
they did not know was that their beloved first born would be a son who,
one day, would become the first President of the United States of
America&mdash;an office and a nation not yet dreamed of by any man. They
did not know that their tiny son&rsquo;s deeds and character would, in time,
make him an immortal figure in the history of the new nation. Nor
did they know that, before 200 years would pass, a city given his name
would be the capital of a great World Power.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><span class="sc">VIRGINIA IN 1732.</span></h3>
<p>In 1732, 125 years had passed since the founding at
Jamestown of the first successful English colony in America. The
county of Westmoreland had been established for 79 years, and three-quarters
of a century had gone by since Augustine&rsquo;s grandfather, John
Washington, had settled in Virginia. Williamsburg had been the
capital of the colony for 33 years, and William and Mary College was
in its 40th year. Some of Augustine&rsquo;s older friends remembered
Bacon&rsquo;s Rebellion, which had flared up and had been extinguished by
Governor Berkeley 56 years earlier. Augustine himself certainly remembered
news of the fight between Blackbeard&rsquo;s pirates and Virginia
sailors, for only 14 years had gone by since the ruthless pirate leader had
been killed off Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
Augustine also remembered accounts of the expedition Governor Spotswood
had led to the distant Blue Ridge Mountains in 1716, for this
adventuresome exploit was still discussed by the tidewater planters who
coveted the little-known lands beyond the distant mountains.</p>

<p>There were only two towns in Virginia of any considerable size&mdash;Williamsburg
and Norfolk&mdash;by 1732. The population of the colony
was estimated at 114,000, of which 76,000 were whites and 38,000
Negroes. George Gooch was Lieutenant Governor of the Royal Province
and George II was in the 6th year of his reign.</p>
<p>In 1732 William Byrd of &ldquo;Westover&rdquo; and Peter Jones were surveying
the North Carolina-Virginia boundary line, and another year was to
go by before Petersburg and Richmond would be laid out as townsites.
There was not a single newspaper in Virginia in 1732; Augustine may
have read <i>The Maryland Gazette</i> (published in Annapolis by W. Parks
at 15 shillings a year) or one printed in London.</p>
<p>Tobacco was the important money crop, and almost every ship that
sailed from a plantation wharf carried hogsheads of the &ldquo;delightful
weed&rdquo; in its hold. Many other commodities, too, were shipped to the
mother country as well as to New England, the middle colonies, Barbados,
Madeira, Bermuda, and Jamaica. Exports from one Virginia
shipping district&mdash;Porth South Potomac&mdash;in 1732 included (besides
tobacco) staves, timber, corn, wheat, peas, beans, masts, pig iron,
feathers, pork, cotton, earthenware &ldquo;parcels,&rdquo; woodenware &ldquo;parcels,&rdquo;
bacon, hides, deerskins, beaver skins, oak and walnut logs, cider and
cider casks, beef, wine pipes, snakeroot, tallow, pewter and brass &ldquo;parcels,&rdquo;
and copper ore casks. Items imported included rum, salt, Irish
linen, fish, chocolate, molasses, sugar, earthernware, &ldquo;woodware,&rdquo;
millstones, Madeira wine, cheese, rice, ironware, and &ldquo;parcels from
Great Britain.&rdquo; The latter &ldquo;parcels&rdquo; included furniture fabrics, rugs,
pottery and porcelain, silver, pewter, copper and brassware, and other
household furnishings and accessories needed by the colonists.</p>

<p>On February 11 (Old Style), 1732&mdash;when jasmine and jonquils were
beginning to bloom and dark purple berries were forming on the
native &ldquo;cedar&rdquo; trees&mdash;Mary Ball Washington gave birth to her first
child, a boy she named George. The time was about 10 o&rsquo;clock in
the morning. At a later date the event was recorded with brevity in
the family Bible:</p>

<p>George Washington son to Augustine &amp; Mary his Wife was Born ye 11th
Day of February 1731/2 about 10 in the Morning &amp; was Baptis&rsquo;d the
5th of April following Mr. Beverley Whiting &amp; Capt Christopher
Brookes godfathers and Mrs. Mildred Gregory godmother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The date, &ldquo;11th Day of February,&rdquo; was &ldquo;Old Style.&rdquo; By the Gregorian
calendar, adopted by Great Britain in 1752 and now in use in the
United States, the date was February 22, 1732, &ldquo;New Style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place where George was baptized on the 5th of April is unknown,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
although the christening probably took place in the Popes
Creek home. If not there, it may have occurred at Mattox Church
(located at Church Point about 2&frac12; miles away) or at Round Hill
Church about 16 miles from the Popes Creek home by road. The
Reverend Roderick McCullough was the minister in charge of the
Episcopal churches in Washington Parish in 1732, but of his actual
administering of the rite there is no record.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the godparents. A Beverley Whiting
served as a burgess from Gloucester County, and a Christopher Brooke
was captain of a Virginia ship, the <i>Cambridge</i>, but there is no evidence
that these men were the ones, with similar names, recorded in the
family Bible. The godmother, Mildred Washington Gregory, was
George&rsquo;s aunt.</p>
<p>The first 3&frac12; years of George&rsquo;s life were spent at the Popes Creek
plantation. At some unknown date between March 25 and November
18, 1735, Augustine Washington moved his family up the Potomac
River about 50 miles to his farm on Hunting Creek (known today as
Mount Vernon). Three years later Augustine purchased a 288-acre
farm near Fredericksburg, and about December 1, 1738 (when George
was almost 7 years old) moved there with his family.</p>
<p>In 1742 Augustine acquired another tract of land between Popes
Creek and Bridges Creek&mdash;within sight of the home where George was
born. With the exception of one piece of property on the river all
of the Popes Creek&mdash;Bridges Creek peninsula was now owned by
George&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>In 1743, a few weeks after George&rsquo;s 11th birthday, Augustine Washington
was stricken with a stomach disorder, and died on the 12th
of April. He was interred in the family burying ground at Bridges
Creek, where his father, Lawrence, and grandfather, John, were
buried. Augustine left the Popes Creek&mdash;Bridges Creek plantation to
his second son and namesake, Augustine, Jr. (one of George&rsquo;s elder
half brothers).</p>
<p>After his father&rsquo;s death it appears that George resided variously
with his mother on her farm near Fredericksburg; at Mount Vernon
with another half brother, Lawrence; at &ldquo;Chotank&rdquo; in King George
County with other relatives; and at his birth home on Popes Creek
with his elder half brother, Augustine, Jr.</p>
<p>The frequency and length of these visits of George to Popes Creek
are not known, but there is ample evidence that he stayed with his
elder brother and sister-in-law on many occasions for long periods.
During such visits he must have become familiar with every nook and
cranny in his birth home, as well as with its outdoor attractions&mdash;the
green fields of tobacco, corn, and wheat; the sweet-scented herb garden;
the domestic animals, and other aspects of farm life beloved by
all boys fortunate enough to know them.</p>

<p>Beyond the cultivated fields grew the dense forest, which only a
century before had been the hunting ground of the Indians. The
dominant trees in the majestic woods were the broadleaf species&mdash;oak,
maple, walnut, hickory, chestnut, holly, dogwood, persimmon, and
tulip-poplar&mdash;interspersed with a few conifers, including cedar and
several species of pine. Wild animals were abundant and young
George probably hunted deer, bear, turkey, and other woodland
creatures.</p>
<p>Tranquil Popes Creek must have had a special appeal to the growing
boy, for along its edge, ducks and wild geese searched for food, and
in its waters swam large turtles and many kinds of fish. More inviting
than the creek, however, was the broad Potomac River&mdash;an invitation
to fish, swim, and sail boat.</p>
<p>All was not play at the Popes Creek plantation. For when George
visited his elder brother he undoubtedly helped with the numerous
farm chores. Then, too, he may have attended the school Henry
Williams conducted near Mattox Creek, although no direct evidence
of this has been found. There is, however, reliable evidence that he
mastered his first lessons in surveying while visiting his birthplace, for
an existing survey of the Bridges Creek area was made by George in
1747, when he was only 15 years old.</p>

<p>It is not known when George left the Popes Creek plantation for
the last time as a youth, but he must have departed with a touch of
sadness. The joys and pleasures of life on such a busy and beautiful
tidewater plantation must have been unforgettable to the tall, teenage
boy.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>The Disastrous Fire</i></span></h2>
<p>George&rsquo;s elder half brother, Augustine Washington, Jr., the second
owner of the Popes Creek home, died in 1762. The plantation passed
to his son, William Augustine Washington, George&rsquo;s eldest nephew.
William Augustine took title in full in 1774 when his mother, Ann
Washington (who had a dower life interest in the estate), died.
About this time the Popes Creek plantation, for the first time, was
called &ldquo;Wakefield,&rdquo; a name said to have been inspired by Oliver Goldsmith&rsquo;s
<i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>, and which has endured.</p>
<p>During the latter part of the American Revolution, when General
Washington was leading the Continental Army in the north, his
birth home in faraway Virginia caught fire and burned to the ground.
Indirect evidence and tradition indicate that the house was destroyed
Christmas Day, 1779. At the time of the fire the structure was owned
by its third and last owner, William Augustine Washington. According
to his daughter, Sarah Tayloe Washington, her father noticed
the roof burning while returning from a ride. It is believed that a
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
spark from the chimney blew through the small garret window and
set fire to the house. The home which had sheltered three generations
of Washingtons for half a century was never rebuilt by them.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>A Century of Neglect</i></span></h2>
<p>After the disastrous fire at Wakefield, 36 years passed before the birthsite
was marked. Finally, in 1815, George Washington Parke Custis
(a grandson of Martha Washington and a ward of George Washington)
visited Popes Creek and, in an imposing ceremony, marked
what he considered to be the spot. Custis, in a letter to the editor of
the Alexandria <i>Gazette</i>, described his visit in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In June, 1815, I sailed on my vessel, the &ldquo;Lady of the Lake&rdquo;, a fine
topsail schooner of ninety tons, accompanied by two gentlemen, Messrs.
Lewis and Grimes, bound to Popes Creek in the County of Westmoreland,
carrying with us a slab of freestone, having the following
inscription:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Here
<br />The 11th of February, 1732, (Old Style)
<br />George Washington
<br />Was Born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We anchored some distance from the land, and taking to our boats,
we soon reached the mouth of Pope&rsquo;s or Bridge&rsquo;s Creek, and proceeding
upwards we fell in with McKenzie Beverly, Esq., and several
gentlemen composing a fishing party, and also with the overseer of
the property that formed the object of our visit. We were kindly
received by these individuals, and escorted to the spot, where a few
scattered bricks alone marked the birthplace of the chief.</p>
<p>Desirous of making the ceremonial of depositing the stone as imposing
as circumstances would permit, we enveloped it in the &ldquo;star
spangled banner&rdquo; of our country, and it was borne to its resting place
in the arms of the descendants of four revolutionary patriots and
soldiers.</p>
<p>We gathered together the bricks of an ancient chimney that once
formed the hearth around which Washington in his infancy had played,
and constructed a rude kind of pedestal, on which we reverently placed
the FIRST STONE commending it to the respect and protection of the
American people in general, and the citizens of Westmoreland County
in particular.</p>
<p>Bidding adieu to those who had received us so kindly, we re-embarked,
and hoisted our colors, and being provided with a piece of
cannon and suitable ammunition, we fired a salute, awakening the
echoes that had slept for ages around the hallowed spot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Custis&rsquo; visit to Washington&rsquo;s birthplace is important for two reasons.
First, the freestone slab which he placed at the birthsite was one of
the earliest monuments erected in the United States as a memorial to
George Washington. Secondly, Custis describes the site as it appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
in 1815 as a &ldquo;spot where a few scattered bricks alone marked the birthplace
of the chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1832, the 100th anniversary of Washington&rsquo;s birth, the Alexandria
<i>Gazette</i> noted how the nation had forgotten the ancient Popes Creek
farm: &ldquo;It is surprising that it [Wakefield] should be so little known
and visited. Not one in a thousand of the passengers in Steamboats
had any knowledge that this &lsquo;solum natale,&rsquo; of him whom the whole
world honors, is remote but a mile over the waters surface; and hid
from his view only by a fringe of wild shrubbery. Will not Wakefield
like Mt. Vernon, in after time, be the resort of Patriotic Pilgrims?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the July 1833 issue of <i>The North American Magazine</i> an unknown
contributor gives a bit of important information about the birth
home: &ldquo;The old house of his [Washington&rsquo;s] birth has long since
mouldered. The cellar over which it stood, now mostly filled up, is
about fifty feet in length from east to west, having what seems to be a
wine vault in the corner. An orchard of apple trees of modern growth
interspersed with other fruit trees, surrounds the old cellar; westerly
of which are scattered some apple trees of a very ancient growth, with
fruit of a delicious flavour. These trees are monuments of olden times;
contemporaries probably with the childhood of the Great Statesman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the years passed during the 19th century, others who visited
Washington&rsquo;s birthplace commented on the neglected condition of the
site. James K. Paulding of New York, a friend of Washington Irving
and author of <i>A Life of Washington</i>, described Wakefield in 1835 as a
place where &ldquo;A few scanty relics alone remain to mark the spot....
A clump of old decayed fig trees, probably coeval with the mansion,
yet exists; a number of vines, and shrubs, and flowers still reproduce
themselves every year as if to mark the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1851 the Richmond <i>Whig and Public Advertiser</i> observed: &ldquo;The
birthplace of George Washington is ... marked only by an old brick
chimney, a mammoth fig tree, and a freestone slab.... The slab is
broken in two.... The neglected condition of the spot bears shame
against his country for neglecting to lift up a monument there, to his
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five years later, in 1856, Bishop William Meade visited Wakefield
and found Custis&rsquo; freestone slab broken into fragments. The Bishop
wrote: &ldquo;I recently paid a visit to the old family seat of the Washingtons....
The brick chimney is all that remains of the Washington
mansion ... except the broken bricks which are scattered about over
the spot where it was built. The grandson of Mrs. General Washington,
Mr. Custis, of Arlington, some years since placed a slab with a brief
inscription on the spot, but it is now in fragments.&rdquo; The same year
Bishop Meade visited Wakefield, Lewis W. Washington offered to the
State of Virginia &ldquo;sixty feet square of ground on which the house stood
in which General Washington was born&rdquo; together with the family
burying ground, provided &ldquo;that the State shall cause the premises to be
permanently enclosed by an iron fence, based on a stone foundation,
and shall mark the same by suitable, and modest, though substantial
tablets, to commemorate for the rising generation these notable spots.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Gov. Henry A. Wise was greatly interested in the offer, and visited
Westmoreland County on April 27, 1858, for the purpose of inspecting
the birthplace site and the Washington family burying ground. As a
result of his visit and consequent recommendations, the Commonwealth
of Virginia accepted the donation and appropriated $5,000 to
carry out the wishes of Lewis W. Washington. Before the protective
steps could be carried out, however, the drumbeats of war were echoing
across the land, and only the ancient fig trees and wild shrubbery continued
to mark the venerable spot.</p>
<p>Five years after the Civil War, a visitor to Wakefield observed that
the freestone slab which George Washington Parke Custis had placed
over the presumed birthsite with such loving care had disappeared.
It had remained there only about 55 years before falling a victim to the
vandalism of that time.</p>
<p>Some time in 1873 the old kitchen chimney, which had withstood
the ravages of the elements for a century and a half, finally collapsed
and fell to the ground. It had stood above ground longer than any
other part of Augustine Washington&rsquo;s plantation buildings which he
had built in the 1720&rsquo;s on Popes Creek.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>The Saving of Washington&rsquo;s Birthplace</i></span></h2>
<p>The saving of Washington&rsquo;s Birthplace was the work of many individuals
and organizations, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Wakefield
National Memorial Association, and the United States Government.</p>
<p>In 1859 John E. Wilson, owner of most of the Popes Creek-Bridges
Creek land, deeded to the Commonwealth of Virginia a right-of-way
through his farm to the birthsite and the Washington family burying
ground, together with one-half acre of land near the latter place and
about 1 acre near the birthsite.</p>
<p>In 1882 the Commonwealth of Virginia vested title in the United
States of America to its holdings at the birthsite and burying ground.
By an act of Congress approved in 1879, and amended in 1881, the construction
of a monument to mark the birthsite and the acquisition of
the necessary ground and right-of-way had been authorized. In 1883
Mr. and Mrs. John. E. Wilson sold to the United States nearly 12 acres of
land surrounding the birthsite and 9.85 acres constituting a right-of-way
50 feet wide and 1.6 miles long, connecting the birthsite, the family
burying ground, and the Potomac River near the mouth of Bridges
Creek.</p>
<p>Although Congress had authorized the construction of a monument
to mark the birthsite in 1881, 15 years passed before the shaft of Vermont
granite was erected. It was a time in our Nation&rsquo;s history when
historical conservation was crowded into the background in favor of
more materialistic aims.</p>
<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s a group of public-spirited women became interested
in the old Washington family plantation. They wanted more than
a granite monument to memorialize the site where our first President
was born, and dreamed of a restored tidewater plantation.
On February 23, 1923, under the able leadership of Mrs. Josephine
Wheelright Rust, they organized the Wakefield National Memorial
Association. Their main objective was to restore the Wakefield
plantation and make it a shrine for all people, the date set for completion
of the task was 1932&mdash;the 200th anniversary of Washington&rsquo;s
birth.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Wakefield National Memorial Association was
incorporated in 1924, its members raised funds for acquiring land
between the birthsite and the Washington family burying ground,
and induced John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to purchase 273 acres of the
old Wakefield plantation and transfer it to the United States Government.
By an act of Congress, approved June 7, 1926, the association
was given authority to construct a house at Wakefield as nearly as
possible like the one built by Augustine Washington. In 1929 the
association acquired additional land, and 2 years later donated its
holding at Wakefield (about 100 acres) to the United States.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>By an act of Congress on January 23, 1930, the 394.47 acres owned
by the Federal Government was designated as George Washington
Birthplace National Monument, to be administered by the National
Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior.</p>
<p>In 1930-31 the Wakefield National Memorial Association, under
its authority from Congress, built an early 18th-century style brick
home as a memorial to mark the approximate site of the home in
which George Washington was born. (The granite shaft which had
marked the site since 1896 was moved to a new location.) As intensive
research had produced very little reliable evidence concerning the
appearance of the original Popes Creek home, the memorial house
erected could not be a replica. It is, however, in keeping with the
Virginia plantation scene at the time of Washington&rsquo;s association
with the place.</p>
<p>The new memorial house was opened to the public in July 1931, and
a special open house was held on February 22, 1932, the 200th anniversary
of George Washington&rsquo;s birth. Since then the Wakefield National
Memorial Association has been active in furnishing the home
with suitable pieces of the 1700-50 period. In many instances 18th-century
artifacts unearthed near the site of the original home have
served as guides in selecting certain items. The objects excavated were
surprisingly varied and revealed the nature of many furnishings which
were in the original home between the time it was completed in 1726
and the time of the disastrous fire in 1779. Only a few types of the
more important artifacts unearthed can be described:</p>

</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Glass.</span></h3>
<p>Hundreds of pieces of broken wine bottles were found, including
11 wine bottle seals bearing the initials of George&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;AW&rdquo;.
During the 18th century only well-to-do planters imported wine bottles
from England with their names or monograms stamped on the necks
of the containers. Many wine-glass stems were also found, revealing
the fine assortment of drinking glasses used by the Washingtons.
Numerous windowpane fragments were unearthed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Tableware.</span></h3>
<p>Many bonehandled knives and forks of excellent quality
were excavated, together with several types of pewter and latten metal
spoons. A few of the knife and fork handles found were dyed green,
described in the 1762 inventory as &ldquo;green Ivory handled knives &amp; forks.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Furniture hardware.</span></h3>
<p>Many brass upholstering tacks, knobs, drawer
pulls, and keyhole escutcheons, which at one time embellished high
quality English furniture of the 1725-75 period, were unearthed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Clay pipes.</span></h3>
<p>Hundreds of fragments of English white clay pipes were
found in the vicinity of the birthsite.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Lighting devices and fireplace equipment.</span></h3>
<p>Brass candlesticks, candlesnuffers,
and brasshandled fireplace tools excavated revealed that
the Washingtons imported fine metalware from the mother country.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Pottery and porcelain.</span></h3>
<p>Countless fragments of colorful earthenware
and stoneware pottery were found, together with a fine assortment of
oriental porcelain. Much of the pottery (including slip-decorated
earthenware, Delftware, white salt-glazed stoneware, &ldquo;Whieldon&rdquo;
ware, hand-decorated Staffordshire, and creamware) was made in England;
some was imported from Holland (tin-glazed Delftware) and
Germany (stoneware), whereas most of the porcelain came from
China.</p>

<p>All pieces of furniture acquired by the association for the memorial
house are of the early 18th-century English styles, having been made
between 1700 and 1750. Only one item in the house, a tilt-top tea table,
is said to have been in the original home. The last owner of the house,
William Augustine Washington (George&rsquo;s eldest nephew), saved it at
the time of the fire in 1779.</p>
<p>The Wakefield National Memorial Association has also acquired
appropriate cooking utensils of the early 18th-century period for the
colonial-style kitchen. Once again, excavated artifacts&mdash;including pot-hooks,
kettle fragments, skewers, ladles, and numerous other cooking
accessories&mdash;were used as guides in locating suitable kitchen equipage.</p>
<p>Since 1932 over a million people from all parts of the world have
visited Wakefield and enjoyed its natural beauties and historical associations.
The serenity of the restored plantation with its cultivated
fields and oldtime flower garden, its fragrant boxwood and sweet-scented
herbs, and the lovely water views afforded by Popes Creek and
the Potomac River, make unforgettable impressions. The memorial
house furnished with beautiful and appropriate pieces from a bygone
day, the early 18th-century style kitchen with its huge fireplace and
ancient cooking equipment, and the family burying ground at Bridges
Creek, almost 300 years old, are integral parts of the scene. In addition
to these glimpses of colonial life are the well-kept grounds, the
carefully tended flower beds, and the grove of native cedar trees which
stand like venerable sentinels on Burnt House Point.</p>
<p>Such enchanting scenes which impress the senses and mind are taken
for granted today, as few pilgrims realize that not so many years ago
the birthplace of our Nation&rsquo;s First Citizen was all but forgotten.
Without the dedicated labor of many people and organizations there
would be no Wakefield plantation today, and to these individuals our
Nation will forever owe a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>But the restored plantation is more than a monument to the people
who saved it. It is a memorial to the boy who played in the red brick
house by the tidal creek, in the stables, barns, tobacco sheds, and other
outbuildings; in the smokehouse and summer kitchen; in the spinning
and weaving house and buttery; and near the forge where the
blacksmith beat red-hot iron rods into tools and hardware and farm
implements. The restored plantation is a shrine to the young boy
with reddish-brown hair and blue eyes who romped through the
green meadows and fields of corn, and watched the growing wheat,
rye, and tobacco; the youth who picked luscious figs, climbed the
gnarled apple trees, and played games in the cedar grove of that day.</p>
<p>Countless times he must have walked along the high banks of
Popes Creek and the sandy shore of the Potomac River, and stalked
game in the nearby forest. Wakefield is a monument to the growing
boy who returned to the place of his birth when he was 11 years old
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
and learned his first lessons in surveying. The impressions which the
peaceful farm made on his mind were lasting ones, and as he grew
from youth into manhood and assumed greater responsibilities, the
happy memories of days spent on his father&rsquo;s plantation were never
forgotten.</p>

<p>The information which follows, supplements that contained in the
narrative of this handbook. It has been arranged to enable you to
make your own tour of the area. The numbers given correspond
to the numbers on the map of the national monument on pages <a href="#Page_34">34</a>-35.</p>
<h3>1. <span class="sc">Granite shaft.</span></h3>
<p>This shaft, of Vermont granite, weighs about 50
tons. It is nearly one-tenth the size of the Washington Monument
in the Nation&rsquo;s capital, and of the same relative proportions. First
erected in 1896 by the War Department (at or near the foundations
of the home in which George Washington was born), it was moved
to its present location near the entrance to the national monument
in 1930.</p>

<h3>5. <span class="sc">Site of Building &ldquo;X.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>So-called because its history is unknown, the
brick foundations of Building &ldquo;X&rdquo; were discovered in 1930. They
were partially unearthed that year, and completely excavated in 1936.
The boxwood plants outline only one room of the building, known
as Unit &ldquo;A.&rdquo; The brick foundations of Building &ldquo;X&rdquo; were the most
extensive ones unearthed at Wakefield. Including the projecting
wings, the foundations were almost 70 feet long. The center of the
building was approximately 19 feet wide. One wing was 22 feet
wide, the other 32 feet wide. The possibility that it, rather than the
smaller foundation on the memorial mansion site about 60 feet away,
was the exact spot where George Washington was born cannot be
ignored and will perhaps always remain an intriguing question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3><span class="sc">6. Memorial house.</span></h3>
<p>This was built in 1930-31. The furnishings are
of the 1700-50 period. One item, a tilt-top table, is the only existing
piece of furniture said to have been in the original house at Wakefield,
having been saved at the time of the fire in 1779. Much of the pottery,
porcelain, glassware, tableware, and metalware in the house are similar
in period and style to many of the artifacts which were unearthed near
the birthsite during archeological excavations.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">7. Colonial-style garden.</span></h3>
<p>South of the memorial house is a colonial-type
garden enclosed by a handsplit picket fence. It is connected with
the memorial house by a boxwood-lined brick walk. The English
boxwood is well over a century old, and was transplanted from the
home, 8 miles away, of Sarah Tayloe Washington (a daughter of the
last occupant and owner of the home in which George Washington
was born.) It is believed to have grown from cuttings originally
taken from Wakefield. In this fragrant, old-fashioned garden, will be
found many plants that were common to Virginia gardens during the
period of George Washington&rsquo;s youth. Here are sweet-scented herbs
such as sage, thyme, hyssop, wormwood, marjoram, rue, tansy, pennyroyal,
basil, hoarhound, snakeroot, true lavender, caraway, and others
used for cooking and medicinal purposes. Among the colorful
flowers are old roses, hollyhocks, lilies, bleedinghearts, forget-me-nots,
love-in-a-mist, narcissi, iris, and heliotrope.</p>

<h3>8. <span class="sc">Grove of eastern redcedars.</span></h3>
<p>South of the colonial garden is a magnificent
grove of eastern redcedars, <i>Juniperus virginiana</i>. The grove
covers Burnt House Point, which juts out into Popes Creek.</p>
<h3>9. <span class="sc">The kitchen and historical museum.</span></h3>
<p>The colonial-style kitchen
building is located about 50 feet west of the memorial house. Its old
chimney was the last above-ground brickwork of the original buildings
at Wakefield owned by George Washington&rsquo;s father. Still standing
in 1872, when it was sketched by a visiting artist, it finally collapsed
and fell to the ground the following year. In 1930 the foundations
of the old kitchen were uncovered, and subsequently a colonial-style
building was constructed on the site. The east room in the building
has been furnished with cooking utensils, kitchen accessories, fireplace
equipment, and furniture of the 1700-50 period. The west room is
used for the display of colonial artifacts which were unearthed at
Bridges Creek and from various foundations found near the site of the
original home on Popes Creek. The exhibits relate to the history of
the Bridges Creek and Popes Creek plantations as well as to the activities
of the early Washingtons who lived there.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h3>10. <span class="sc">Site of smokehouse.</span></h3>
<p>The boxwood plants mark the site of an old
building foundation believed to be that of an early 18th-century smokehouse.
Excavated in 1936, the building had brick foundations as well
as a brick floor. The foundations were located about 65 feet west of
the kitchen building.</p>
<h3>11. <span class="sc">Duck Hall parking and picnic area.</span></h3>
<p>This section of the national
monument is located approximately three-quarters of a mile northeast
of the granite shaft. It may be reached over a paved road which runs
north from the granite shaft for about one-fourth of a mile, then turns
eastward. From the Duck Hall picnic area may be seen magnificent
views of Popes Creek and the Potomac River.</p>
<h3>12. <span class="sc">Site of 17th-century brick building.</span></h3>
<p>In 1934 brick foundations
of a small 17th-century building were unearthed about 180 feet southeast
of the Washington family burying ground. One glass bottle seal
found near the building site was inscribed with the name &ldquo;John
Washington.&rdquo; The structure was probably an outbuilding which
belonged to George Washington&rsquo;s great-grandfather.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="439" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Washington family burying ground.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>13. <span class="sc">Washington family burying ground.</span></h3>
<p>Established by John Washington,
the founder of the Washington family in Virginia, the family
burying ground is located about 1 mile north of the granite shaft. In
his will, John, the great-grandfather of George, asked &ldquo;to be buried
on ye plantation wheire I now live, by the side of my wife yt is already
buried.&rdquo; In the years that followed, members of succeeding generations
of Washingtons found final resting place in the ancient cemetery.
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Here the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of George Washington,
together with 29 other early members of the family, are
interred. In 1906 the Colonial Dames of Virginia made some improvements
at the burying ground. In 1930, under the auspices of the
Wakefield National Memorial Association, the burying ground was
enclosed by a wall of handmade bricks. Five new tablestones were
erected and the area was appropriately landscaped. A parking area
is located about 300 feet east of the burying ground.</p>
<p>The tract of land surrounding the burying ground was purchased
by John Washington in 1664 from David Anderson. The site of
his home is in the vicinity of the burying ground.</p>
<h3>14. <span class="sc">Potomac River view.</span></h3>
<p>About a quarter of a mile north of the
Washington family burying ground is the south shore of the Potomac
River. Here may be seen a delightful view of the river, approximately
5 miles wide at this point. President James Monroe, the fifth President,
was born on a farm facing the deep bay on the extreme left.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>How To Reach the Monument</i></span></h2>
<p>George Washington Birthplace is 72 miles south of Washington,
D. C., via the Potomac River Bridge. It may also be reached from
Washington by way of Mount Vernon and Fredericksburg, a distance
of 83 miles. The national monument is 69 miles northeast of
Richmond, by way of Bowling Green and Port Royal, or 75 miles
via U. S. 360, and State Routes 3 and 204. It is 100 miles from Williamsburg
and 123 miles from Norfolk over good roads. Washington&rsquo;s
Birthplace is on the Potomac River, and should not be confused
with Wakefield, Va., which is in Sussex County, south of the James
River.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>About Your Visit</i></span></h2>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
